Computed carousel motor torque limit based on tether breaking = Not meaningful; if tether is anchored to ground, and aligned with arm, torque limit would have to be zero.

----------------- Decisions! --------------

Carousel motor torque limit is chosen to be 19 N-m.
Rationale: This should prevent the belt from breaking.

Chosen carousel speed limit is 1 rps = 60 rpm
Rationale: 
* This speed is already getting a bit scary.
* At this speed a ball on a short tether is already hanging almost straight out.
* With a plane flying at a significant tether length, the airspeed would be absurd,
	so this constraint isn't expected to be active anyway.
Carousel motor shaft speed at this limit is (1 rps) * (14.86) * (3/2) = 22.29 rps = 1337.4 rpm

Chosen carousel motor current limit of 10A is an INACTIVE constraint (it becomes active at around 6.4A)
Carousel power at (max torque x max speed) = 19 N-m
Chosen carousel motor power limit is 8 kW, and is an INACTIVE constraint (torque*speed limits first)

Computed mechanical carousel power consumption of carousel drive at max torque, max speed: (19 N-m)*(22.29*2*pi rad/sec ) = 2661 W
power left over for the winch drive to operate at the same time: (7360 - 2661) = 4699 W

Chosen winch motor torque limit is 70 N-m.  
Rationale: 
* This torque should prevent the belt from breaking
* In steady state, this is enough torque to break the tether BUT
	* We plan to add a weak link to the tether anyway
	* A portion of the winch motor torque is needed to accelerate the drum,
		so this "extra" torque can be applied while the drum is accelerating
		without breaking the tether, in principle.
Chosen winch current limit is 85A (same as the max power unit output current), is an INACTIVE constriant.
Chosen winch power limit is 7.3 kW

Chosen winch motor shaft speed limit is 1500 rpm (limited by the gearbox input speed)
