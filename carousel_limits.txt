Computed carousel motor torque limit based on tether breaking = Not meaningful; if tether is anchored to ground, and aligned with arm, torque limit would have to be zero.

----------------- Decisions! --------------

Carousel motor torque limit is chosen to be: 
float chosen_carousel_motor_torque_limit = 19.0; // N-m
Rationale: This should prevent the belt from breaking.

Chosen carousel speed limit is 1 rps = 60 rpm
Rationale: 
* This speed is already getting a bit scary.
* At this speed a ball on a short tether is already hanging almost straight out.
* With a plane flying at a significant tether length, the airspeed would be absurd,
	so this constraint isn't expected to be active anyway.
Carousel motor shaft speed at this limit is (1 rps) * (14.86) * (3/2) = 22.29 rps = 1337.4 rpm
float chosen_carousel_motor_shaft_speed_limit = 1337.4; // rpm

Chosen carousel motor current limit of 10A is an INACTIVE constraint (it becomes active at around 6.4A)
Carousel power at (max torque x max speed) = 19 N-m
Chosen carousel motor power limit is 8 kW, and is an INACTIVE constraint (torque*speed limits first)

Computed mechanical carousel power consumption of carousel drive at max torque, max speed: (19 N-m)*(22.29*2*pi rad/sec ) = 2661 W
power left over for the winch drive to operate at the same time: (7360 - 2661) = 4699 W

Chosen winch motor torque limit is 70 N-m.  
float chosen_winch_motor_torque_limit = 70.0; // N-m

Rationale: 
* This torque should prevent the belt from breaking
* In steady state, this is enough torque to break the tether BUT
	* We plan to add a weak link to the tether anyway
	* A portion of the winch motor torque is needed to accelerate the drum,
		so this "extra" torque can be applied while the drum is accelerating
		without breaking the tether, in principle.
Chosen winch current limit is 85A (same as the max power unit output current), is an INACTIVE constriant.
Chosen winch power limit is 7.3 kW (same as max. power from wall)

Chosen winch motor shaft speed limit is 1500 rpm.  This number was chosen arbitrarily; the winch motor can operate at higher speeds, but then the tether will be traveling extremely fast.
