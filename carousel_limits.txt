Both motors to through a reducing gearbox and a (usually) reducing belt.  The motor torque limits are set at the breaking point of the belt, with a safety margin.  Since we don't account for the inertia of the motor rotors, the torque limits are conservative.

tensile strength of the belts: 
6500 N

Safety Factor: 3/4

tensile stength of the tether:
3000 Newtons

Carousel drive gearbox ratio:
14.86

Carousel drive pulley ratio: (not used)
2/3

Carousel drive pulley diameter
0.12545 meters

(Carousel motor's intrinsic torque limit) 26.53 N-m
(computed torque limit based on belt breaking)  20 N-m
(computed torque limit based on tether breaking) Not meaningful; if tether is anchored to ground, and aligned with arm, torque limit would have to be zero.

Winch drive gearbox ratio:
1/3

Winch drive pulley diameter on motor side:
0.10186 meters

Winch drive pulley diameters on drum side:
0.10186 meters

Drum diameter:
0.2 meters

(computed winch torque limit based on carousel belt breaking) 82 N-m
(computed winch torque limit based on tether breaking) 75 N-m

Chosen motor torque limit is 82.  
Rationale: in the event that we are flying near our physical limits, we want the motor to still try to hold the tether to keep the plane from getting away.
