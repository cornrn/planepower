This is the code Milan Vukov wrote to run on the Stellaris EKK-LM3S9B92 development board
that we use in the indoor plane. 

The guys who developed this board (CodeSourcery) got bought by MentorGraphics, and then by TI itself,
and the board has been discontinued in 2012.  However, it has advantages over all other similar boards
available:

* The LM3S9B92 chip has INTEGRATED ethernet, including the PHY (ethernet hardware layer)
* It is narrow enough to fit in our small indoor plane
* It really doesn't have any other crap on the board taking up space unnecessarily.
* It is oriented towards bare metal programming, whereas most new boards are running a non-hard real time
version of linux.
* It is programmable directly with the USB JTAG interface that came with the kit; less bootloader bs.

We still have several spare boards left, and the code already works, so it may make sense to continue
using in future planes as well.
