This component (when it is done) should contain a model of our carousel
that is free running, for testing orocos deployment scripts, as well
as control algorithms, with something like the timing we will have
on the actual hardware.

It contants the open-loop speed -> elevation angle lookup tables, 
since in some sense that is part of our system model.
