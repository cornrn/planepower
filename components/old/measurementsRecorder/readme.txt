     measurementsRecoder
	  In a fixed-length buffer, record all of the measurements that (would)
	  get passed into into the dynamicMHE state estimator component.

	  Useful for testing MHE state estimators and (open loop) controllers
	  on "real" data from the carousel, without having to actually rotate
	  the carousel.
